# [Project 1: Call Center performance analysis and visualization](https://github.com/wcstrickland/call_center)
Business Case: A call center supervisor is provided an excel spreadsheet with performance metrics generated by call monitoring software and desires a format with improved insight.

Reformatted [original](images/call_raw_xl.png) excel workbook designed for rudimentary analysis.
Then used Python to reorganize data and calculate new fields specific to business case,
and generated [statistical analysis](images/jupyter_img.png) of performance by group. 
Finally, exported data to tableau and created [interactive dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/shared/KXPPY74GJ?:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link) for the end user.

# [Project 2: Convert CSV file to SQL insert statement](https://github.com/wcstrickland/csv_to_sql)
A python script that converts an existing CSV file to an SQL insert statement.

The program automatically determines column names by reading the first row of the CSV file, attempts to resolve any conflicts with SQL compatibility such as whitespace,
or prohibited symbols, and then generates the values in SQL format. The resulting text file allows the user to cast data types, assign keys, or auto-incrementation as
well as resolve any reserved word conflicts.

The program provides a GUI to input the desired table name and prompts for opening the source CSV file and the name and directory location of the newly created
text file.

The goal of the project was to provide a tool to quickly migrate files to a SQL database in instances where an import wizard was unavailable or would become
bogged down while creating large insert statements. After casting dtypes and asigning keys the .txt file can be saved as a .sql script and ran.

# [Project 3: Rock Paper Scissors Game](https://github.com/wcstrickland/rock_paper_scissors)
A simple graphical game of Rock Paper Scissors.

I undertook this project using Tkinter rather than pygame as a means of learning how to draw GUI elements, create buttons, bind actions to buttons, and dynamically alter elements of the widget, based on user input. 

This project improved my understanding of:
- creating GUI elements
-linking element behavior
-controlling loop flow
-calling on external image assets dynamically
- the random module in the python standard library
-using python nested dictionaries to evaluate input
