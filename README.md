# [Project 1: Call Center performance analysis and visualization](https://github.com/wcstrickland/call_center)
Business Case: A call center supervisor is provided an excel spreadsheet with performance metrics generated by call monitoring software and desires a format with improved insight.

Reformatted [original](images/call_raw_xl.png) excel workbook designed for rudimentary analysis.
Then used Python to reorganize data and calculate new fields specific to business case,
and generated [statistical analysis](images/jupyter_img.png) of performance by group. 
Finally, exported data to tableau and created [interactive dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/shared/KXPPY74GJ?:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link) for the end user.
