# [Project 1: Call Center performance analysis and visualization](https://github.com/wcstrickland/call_center)
#### Business Case: A call center supervisor is provided an excel spreadsheet with performance metrics generated by call monitoring software and desires a format with improved insight.

Reformatted [original](images/call_raw_xl.png) excel workbook designed for rudimentary analysis.
Then used Python to reorganize data and calculate new fields specific to business case,
and generated [statistical analysis](images/jupyter_img.png) of performance by group. 
Finally, exported data to tableau and created [interactive dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/shared/KXPPY74GJ?:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link) for the end user.

# [Project 2: Convert CSV file to SQL insert statement](https://github.com/wcstrickland/csv_to_sql)
#### A python script that converts an existing CSV file to an SQL insert statement.

The program automatically determines column names by reading the first row of the CSV file, attempts to resolve any conflicts with SQL compatibility such as whitespace,
or prohibited symbols, and then generates the values in SQL format. The resulting text file allows the user to cast data types, assign keys, or auto-incrementation as
well as resolve any reserved word conflicts.

The program provides a GUI to input the desired table name and prompts for opening the source CSV file and the name and directory location of the newly created
text file.

The goal of the project was to provide a tool to quickly migrate files to a SQL database in instances where an import wizard was unavailable or would become
bogged down while creating large insert statements. After casting dtypes and asigning keys the .txt file can be saved as a .sql script and ran.

# [Project 3: Rock Paper Scissors Game](https://github.com/wcstrickland/rock_paper_scissors)
#### A simple graphical game of Rock Paper Scissors.

I undertook this project using Tkinter rather than pygame as a means of learning how to draw GUI elements, create buttons, bind actions to buttons, and dynamically alter elements of the widget, based on user input. 

This project improved my understanding of:
- creating GUI elements
- linking element behavior
- controlling loop flow
- calling on external image assets dynamically
- the random module in the python standard library
- using python nested dictionaries to evaluate input

# [Project 4: Web Scraper and REST API](https://github.com/wcstrickland/news_api)
#### A REST API interfacing with a data base of news articles scraped from a website in JSON like format.

##### Part 1
Created a web scraping program that requests html from a major news outlet and then parses the request return via tags. 
##### Part 2
Created a front facing API that allows users to search the data base with high level of specificity through a series of endpoints. This api supports programming language interaction but can be searched via the URL in the browser by anyone.
##### Phase 3 
Created a simple static html page with  a brief description of the API’s endpoints and provided examples on how to properly use them. 
This project includes:
- web scraping and html tags
- outputting python results to a sqlite database
- Flask, specifically establishing  a connection to a database, establishing @app routes, and defining resources and underlying methods. 
- Writing raw SQL queries and relating them to python programs.

# [Project 5: Priority Queue Scheduler](https://github.com/wcstrickland/priorityqueue)
## Concept
The program allows the creation of Employees, Jobs, and Priority levels. Jobs have several properties including a priority level, a length of time the job has been listed, and an estimated time the job will take to complete. The program assigns “jobs” to employees always allocating the highest priority level job that has been listed the longest. This system ensures the most important jobs are evenly distributed across employees for simultaneous completion to prevent bottlenecking. Employees are scheduled up until they reach their “max hours” for the day, which may vary if the employee is part-time or working a half-day. A threshold can be set to provide an alert if there are jobs left outstanding in a priority level after scheduling to determine resource management such as authorizing overtime or using temp employees. 

## Practical Highlights:
- Versatile: can be applied to any allocation of a prioritized workflow (maintenance work orders, call center hold queue, patient intake in a hospital)
- Streamlined: user input required only at the level of necessity such as creating a work order or determining employees who are not working on a given day. Jobs are automatically added to appropriate queues, and warnings are provided if inputs are malformed such as creating a job with a priority level that does not exist.
- Reusable
- Efficient


## Technical Highlights:
- Use of unit testing
- Use of max heap to create priority queues based on the attribute of an object to optimize performance
- Use of modulo in a  generator in conjunction with a range-based for loop to “wrap” around to the beginning of a list and “remember” the last item the next time the for loop is accessed in code.
